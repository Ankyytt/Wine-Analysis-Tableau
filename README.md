📊 Dataset Overview
  
  The dataset consists of 1,300 entries with 47 attributes, categorized as follows:
  
  Chemical Properties: Acidity, alcohol content, pH, sulfates, etc.
  
  Sensory Scores: Clarity, flavor intensity, tannin levels.
  
  Market Features: Price, vintage year, region, grape variety.
  
  Categorical Attributes: Wine type (Red, White, Rosé), food pairings.

🔬 Analysis Methodology

    1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
    
    Handling missing values and normalizing numerical attributes.
    
    Outlier detection and removal for better insights.
    
    2️⃣ Descriptive Statistics & Correlation Analysis
    
    Calculating key metrics (mean, median, variance).
    
    Identifying relationships between chemical attributes and quality scores.
    
    3️⃣ Comparative & Advanced Analysis
    
    Segmenting data by wine type, region, and variety.
    
    Computing derived indicators (e.g., sugar-acidity ratio, alcohol-tannin balance).

📈 Key Findings & Insights

    Chemical & Quality Correlations: Higher alcohol content correlates with better sensory scores.
    
    Sensory Profiles: Red wines have higher tannin levels, whereas white wines are smoother.
    
    Market Dynamics: Premium wines mostly originate from Bordeaux and Napa Valley.
    
    Regional Variations: European wines have higher acidity, while New World wines focus on bolder flavors.

📊 Tableau Dashboards

    Global Wine Trends: Price and production diversity across regions.
    
    Luxury Wine Brands: Pricing, quality ratings, and food pairings.
    
    Wine Profiles: Flavor intensity, acidity levels, and alcohol content.
    
    Vintage Wines of Argentina: Price and quality trends over time.
    
    Wine Pairings: Matching grape varieties with ideal food pairings.

🚀 Future Work

    Enhancing Data Quality: Incorporating consumer reviews and additional market trends.
    
    Advanced Analytics: AI-driven predictive modeling for pricing and quality trends.
    
    Mobile & Web Integration: Interactive applications for personalized wine recommendations.
